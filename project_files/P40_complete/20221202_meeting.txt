PIE CHARTS

(separate pie charts for median to get rid of outliers)
two pie charts, one for all KC and one for just the median 11 without the outlier 

(in excel spreadsheet far to the right)
11 from KCG with most fields(6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17)-CUTOUT LOW END OF KCG
11 from KC(1 - most active)-CUTOUT HIGH END, making the two groups as similar as possible
still looks like more activity in KC than KCG
