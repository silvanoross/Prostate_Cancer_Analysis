make histograms of the data for reader
or pie chart - more efficient use of space with color coding
hold off until we have 

summarize the total from all the mice


methods paper 

P40 analysis, not a lot of detail about the code,
stick with P40 data 



Make adm from last two mice
take 0 score a step down, even smaller, can just tell the reader about the small 

Pie chart - activity of ADM KC compared to KCG, percentage
histogram - average number of lesions per field 


for KCG dots bright red but size of dot is small because fewer lesions per field

KC lots of lesions, but will be blue because only 25%, 



## 120 = 3 variables

num lesions, 0-9, - colors, a switch from previous

pct_field_covered = <25 - 100, size

adm = shape - , yellow ring around square or X, or TRIANGLE, POINTED DOWN, yellow circle 

run both ways, dot size for lesions or colors, 


## P40 change to triangles and replot with new adm data
